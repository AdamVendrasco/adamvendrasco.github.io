I’m a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, specializing in experimental particle physics. I work on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. At CMS, we strive to make precise measurements of Standard Model physics and look for signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model. My thesis focuses on searches for new physics using CMS proton-proton collision data.
