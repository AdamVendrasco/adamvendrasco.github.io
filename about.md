I’m a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, specializing in experimental particle physics. I work on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland. At CMS, we strive to make precise measurements of Standard Model physics and look for signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model. My thesis focuses on searches for new physics using CMS proton-proton collision data.

### Work:
I am a part of the high-energy physics group at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and our group specializes in searches for new physics that could have unconventional signatures. My thesis involves searches for unconventional signatures in the form of very massive new particles with metastable lifetimes. Due to their theorized high mass, and in combination with their metastable lifetimes, it is possible these objects could leave extremely high ionization deposition within CMS. 


My work involves two areas of study: physics data analysis and hardware upgrades.
