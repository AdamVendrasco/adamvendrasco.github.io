### Work:
I am a part of the high-energy physics group at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and our group specializes in searches for new physics that could have unconventional signatures. My thesis involves searches for unconventional signatures in the form of very massive new particles with metastable lifetimes. Due to their theorized high mass, and in combination with their metastable lifetimes, it is possible these objects could leave extremely high ionization deposition within CMS.
