I am a member of the high-energy physics group at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where we support CMS operations and analyze data from the CMS experiment at CERN in Switzerland. My research focuses on searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, with an emphasis on Supersymmetry. My doctoral thesis invoves analazying data taken from CMS searching for what is known as long-lived particles with a particlar focus on Heavy Stable Charged Particles. Otherwise known as HSCPs, they can arise from a broad range of beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios and due to thier metastable lifetime could produce distinctive, unconventional signatures in the CMS detector. 

In parallel with my data analysis work, I am currently based at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, where I contribute to the CMS Phase-2 upgrade program by performing quality assurance and quality control of Outer Tracker modules to be installed into CMS in preperation for the High-Luminosity LHC. These modules will enable CMS to support the new increased collision rate provided by the High-Luminosity LHC, allowing CMS to collect larger datasets and, hopefully, allow us to uncover new physics phenomena.
